# Actix Permissions [![Continuous Integration](https://github.com/eisberg-labs/actix-permissions/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/eisberg-labs/actix-permissions/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![cargo-badge][]][cargo] [![license-badge][]][license]

Permission and input validation extension for Actix Web. Alternative to actix guard, with access to app data injections, HttpRequest and Payload.
Permissions are flexible, take a look at [Examples directory](./examples) for some of the use cases.

You could write a permission check like a function or like a struct.  
This code:
```rust
async fn is_allowed(
    req: HttpRequest
) -> actix_web::Result<bool> {
    todo!();
}
``` 
is almost the same as writing:
```rust
struct IsAllowed;

impl Permission<()> for IsAllowed {
    type Future = Ready<actix_web::Result<bool>>;
    
    fn call(&self, req: HttpRequest, ctx: ()) -> Ready<actix_web::Result<bool>> {
        todo!();
    }
}
```

# Example
Dependencies:  
```toml
[dependencies]
actix-permissions = "1.0.0"
```
Code:
```rust
use actix_permissions::*;
use actix_web::web::Data;
use actix_web::*;
use serde::Deserialize;

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Deserialize)]
pub struct MyStatus {
    pub status: Option<String>,
}

async fn dummy_permission_check(
    _req: HttpRequest,
    dummy_service: web::Data<DummyService>,
    data: web::Query<MyStatus>,
) -> actix_web::Result<bool> {
    // Unecessary complicating permission check to show what it can do.
    // You have access to request, payload, and all injected dependencies through app_data.
    Ok(dummy_service.check(data.status.clone()))
}

struct DummyService;

impl DummyService {
    pub fn check(&self, value: Option<String>) -> bool {
        value == Some("all".to_string())
    }
}

async fn index() -> Result<String, Error> {
    Ok("Hi there!".to_string())
}

#[actix_web::main]
async fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    HttpServer::new(|| {
        App::new()
            .app_data(Data::new(DummyService))
            .service(web::scope("").route("/", check(web::get(), dummy_permission_check, index)))
    })
        .bind("127.0.0.1:8888")?
        .run()
        .await
}
```
## Use Cases
Take a look at [Examples directory](./examples).
You could use actix-permissions for role based authorization check, like in *role-based-authorization* example.  
*hello-world* example is just a proof of concept, showing how you can set permission,
access service request, payload and injected services.

## Permission Deny
By default, 403 is returned for failed permission checks. You may want to toggle between `Unauthorized` and `Forbidden`,
maybe customize 403 forbidden messages. That's why `check_with_custom_deny` is for.
Take a look at [role based authorization example](./examples/role-based-authorization) for more info.
